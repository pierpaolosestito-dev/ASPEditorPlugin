% INPUT facts
table(T,NC). % the set of available tables with corresponding seats
guest(P). % the set of guests to be accommodated
like(P1,P2). % couples of guests who are friends
dislike(P1,P2). % couples of guests disliking each other

% OUTPUT predicates
at(P,T). %guest P is accommodated to table T

% Given some tables of nc chairs each, generate a sitting
% arrangement for a number of given guests.
at(P,T) | not_at(P,T) :- guest(P), table(T,_).
% Each table must not host more than NC guests.
:- table(T,NC), not #count{P : at(P,T)} <= NC.
%Each guest must be assigned one and only one table.
:- guest(P), not #count {T : at(P,T) }=1.
% People liking each other should sit at the same table.
:- like(P1,P2), at(P1,T), not at(P2,T).
% People disliking each other should not sit at the same table.
:- dislike(P1,P2), at(P1,T), at(P2,T).
